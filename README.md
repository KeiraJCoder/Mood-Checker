# Interactive Mood Board

An educational JavaScript mini-project designed to teach DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling through a creative and accessible interface.

This project allows users to record their mood visually. Each mood entered is represented on the board, and learners can interact with both the board and a toggleable mood-colour key.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Interactive Mood Board demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an engaging, interactive web page.

Learners can:
- Add moods using a text input field.
- Display the mood as a new item on the board.
- Dynamically colour each mood item.
- Toggle a Mood Colour Key on and off using a button.

The project reinforces core front-end skills:
- DOM element creation and manipulation
- Event listeners (`click`, `submit`)
- Form handling with `preventDefault()`
- Conditional logic
- Clean and readable CSS grid layout
